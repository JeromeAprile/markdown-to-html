<p>
    That day, I didn't hear my alarm clock ring, I walked with my socks on the still wet bathroom floor, I arrived late for the first appointment of my day, I forgot my phone at home... 
    <br>Truly the kind of day that makes you want to go back to bed and wait for tomorrow.
    <br>When I returned from work, I decided to treat myself with a takeaway pizza (with pineapple on it for sure) for comfort, but I got stuck in traffic on the way back and when I finally arrived home... it was cold (just my luck)!
    <br>So, I decided to put the pizza in the oven for a few moments to warm it up and went to take off my jacket. I grabbed my phone that I had forgotten on the table in the morning and checked all the notifications I had received throughout the day, then I got lost scrolling through Instagram (classic).
    <br><br>"Hey, it's funny, it looks like there's smoke in the kitchen, doesn't it?"
    <br><br>Lost in distraction, I had put the pizza in the oven with its cardboard box, and it had caught fire.
    <br>My first reflex was to blow on it to try to extinguish the flames.
    <br>I finally managed to put it out with a wet towel.
    <br>I didn't eat any pizza.
    <br>I spent the following week scrubbing every corner of the kitchen that had been stained with soot.
    <br><br>Probably one of the best days of my life.
